FinOps Personas
Framework Overview / FinOps Personas


Implementing FinOps requires many stakeholders, or Personas,
in an organization to work collaboratively with the FinOps team. It
is not only the FinOps team who perform FinOps activities. All
FinOps Personas involved in using, tracking, managing, or
directing the use of cloud will benefit from working together using
the FinOps Framework as an operating model.


Personas represent broad stakeholder groups that must collaborate,
not individual people. In a complex organization, a Persona may
represent many people in various related roles, and in very small
organizations, a single person may perform the duties of multiple
Personas. Each has an important part to play in supporting FinOps.




Core Personas
Within most organizations, there are Core Personas who will always be
involved in the practice of FinOps. These Core Personas provide all of the
organizational disciplines to successfully use cloud effectively. Each Persona
has a role to play in the organization as well as in the practice of FinOps, and
each has perspectives, challenges, metrics and outcomes they seek that
may be slightly different from other Personas.

Allied Personas
Organizations may have roles that are not directly involved in the practice of
FinOps. These Allied Personas work within traditional or emerging
disciplines – including Sustainability, ITAM, ITFM/TBM, Security, and
ITSM/ITIL – and may need to coordinate with FinOps Practitioners. Their
roles align with the "Intersecting Disciplines" Framework Capability which
outlines where their activities intersect with FinOps.
